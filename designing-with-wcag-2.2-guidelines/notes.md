### Introduction

#### Inside the WCAG 2.2 accessibility (a11y) guidelines

#### Course use case

- 3 levels of WCAG compliance: A, AA, AAA

  > WCAG A - Minimum level:
  > - Beginning stage, users can navigate with some issues but still have some degree of understanding
  > - Barriers exist that cannot be overcome by assistive technology
  > - Affects the broadest group with the most benefits and is essential

  > WCAG AA - More accessible:
  > - Standard for most, if not all commercial sites
  > - Some barriers will still exist with the minimum level of support
  > - Impacts certain groups of users
  > - Should work with most assistive technology on desktop and mobile devices
  > - May impact the look of a page or affect site logic to a greater extent

  > WCAG AAA - Even more accessible:
  > - Standard for most/all government sites
  > - Highest level of conformance
  > - Some criteria cannot be applied everywhere, so is generally not required
  > - Even meeting AAA does not make pages accessible to everyone
